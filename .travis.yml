# Define which python version to build against.
# As blender comes bundled with it's own python you can use just one version if you like

before_install:
  # update apt-gets repository sources
  - sudo apt-get update -qq

  # install blender from official sources.
  # This will most propably install an outdated blender version,
  # but it will resolve all system dependencies blender has to be able to run.
  - sudo apt-get install blender

install:
  # codecoverage
  - pip install codecov

  # create temp directory where we store a recent blender version
  - mkdir tmp && cd tmp

  # download the blender version you want to test against

  # Extract the archive
  - tar jxf blender-2.78-092cbcd-linux-glibc219-x86_64.tar.bz2

  # rename the extracted folder to "blender" for easier reference
  - mv blender-2.78-092cbcd-linux-glibc219-x86_64 blender

  # remove the archive, we do not need it anymore
  - rm blender-2.78-092cbcd-linux-glibc219-x86_64.tar.bz2

  # go back to root directory
  - cd ..

  # now create a symlink to the addon within blenders addons directory
  # this is important, because otherwhise blender would not be able to load the addon
  - sudo ln -s ${PWD}/uv_align_distribute ${PWD}/tmp/blender/2.78/scripts/addons/uv_align_distribute

# Finally start our test runner passing it the blender executable from the downloaded blender release
